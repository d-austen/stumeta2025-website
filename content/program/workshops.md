### Fluid Modeling of Atmospheric Flow and Dispersion Phenomena (Prof. Bernd Leitl)

Atmospheric flow and transport can be observed and modelled in different
ways. Besides field observations and computational modeling, physical
modelling of fluid flows represents a well-tried and frequently used
approach for the investigation of complex turbulent flow and dispersion
phenomena particularly in the lower atmospheric boundary layer. The
workshop will very briefly introduce basic theory and modeling
technology used in fluid modeling based on examples form the
Environmental Wind Tunnel Laboratory at Hamburg University. A guided
tour to the wind tunnel lab will be provided at the end of the workshop.

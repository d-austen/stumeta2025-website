### Excursion to the aviation service center of the German Weather Service (Deutschen Wetterdienstes (DWD))
From passenger planes and rescue helicopters to hot air balloons, anyone who wants to be cleared for take-off must be informed about the weather for the sake of security during the flight. What are the challenges in the forecasting of aviation meteorology? What are the differences between forecasting in aviation meteorology and the “normal” meteorology? What does the day-to-day life look like in the field of aviation meteorology? These and all the other questions can be answered during the excursion to the aviation service center of the German Weather Service (Ger.: Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD)) at the Hamburg Helmut Schmidt Airport.

### Miniaturwunderland

Did you enjoy playing with model trains, cars, or plane models as a kid (or even now)? Do you want to see model planes take off and land from a runway like in real life, while trains are moving through tunnels and terrains between different climates and places right around you? Do you want to have a glimpse at what the world of 292,110 miniature figures and 11,080 cars in an area of almost 2000 m2 looks like? If you answered yes to all these questions, or if you just want to witness the largest longest model train track connections in the world, the excursion to the Miniaturwunderland near the old Hamburg Speicherstadt is exactly the place to be!

### Paddling in the Alster canals (weather dependent)
Not only is the Elbe river the only larger water body in Hamburg, but also the Alster lake and its canals, which meander through the heart of the Hamburg city. It provides great opportunities for various water sports, such as paddling. Enjoy a fun and sporty day of paddling in some of the most tranquil canals with all the new, old, and still-yet-to-get-to-know friends from StuMeTa. You may even be accompanied by a flock of swans!

### Hike Travemünde Steilküste (with the possibility for swimming)
One of the nearest locations to beaches and seas for Hamburg is the small town of Travemünde - about 80 km away to the northeast of Hamburg near the city of Lübeck.

This is the hike you want to be at, if you enjoy the scenery of seas and beaches, or want to ponder about land-sea breezes and tidal waves near a large sea...

### Hike to the Harburger Berge/Seevetal 
Despite not having the most impressive mountain ranges like in the Alps or the Harz mountains, Hamburg still has the Harburger Berge, located to the south of Hamburg, with an elevation of a whooping 155 m, the highest natural elevation anywhere near Hamburg. Even though it is not the mountain hike you expect, even though it is a Berg, you are still guaranteed to experience some unique landscapes, vegetations, and with some luck, even some wild animals!

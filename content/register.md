### Information about the registration process
The registration period starts around three months in advance to the event and closes two weeks after opening. 

We hope that we can offer a seat for everyone who is interested, but we cannot garantuee that. In case of more registrations that available seats, we offer participation to people based on the following rules:

* 75% of each city
* first-timers and poster-bringers are prioritized
* first-come first-served

After you got offered a seat you have one week to pay the participation fee. If you don't pay within the given deadline, your seat goes to the next person on the waiting list.

If you would like to cancel your participation you will receive a refund upon 2 weeks prior to the event. After that, please find an alternative participent by yourself.

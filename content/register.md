### Information about the registration process
The registration period starts on 23 February 18:00 CET and closes on 09 March 18:00 CET. 

We hope that we can offer a seat for everyone who is interested, but we cannot garantee that. In case of more registrations than available seats, we draw slots per city based on a fixed percentage. We will inform you about the result of your registration a few days after the registration period closes via email. Check also your spam folder!

If you directly got offered a seat you have two weeks to pay the participation fee. If you don't pay within the given deadline, your seat will be offered to a person on the waiting list. If you were on the waiting list and receive a seat offer, you have one week to pay the participation fee. 

You will receive an email with your workshops and excursion in the beginning of May. 

### Storno

If you would like to cancel your participation you will receive a refund upon 2 weeks prior to the event. After that, please find an alternative participant by yourself.

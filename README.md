# StuMeTa 2025 Website Code

This repository contains the code to make the StuMeTa 2025 Website.


The website is made with [hugo](gohugo.io) and was deployed directly through GitHub Pages (see "deployment" branch"). The export branch contains the adjusted code that makes it possible to navigate from a local filesystem.

It is inspired by the [froscon.org](froscon.org) website.
